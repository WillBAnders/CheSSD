# CheSSD

CheSSD is a chess training tool that allows players to learn chess openings. The
goal is to also show and explain the ideas behind each move to ensure the user
understands the justification behind opening theory.

- This project is sponsored by the University of Florida
  [Society of Software Developers](https://github.com/ufssd), hence the name
  Che**SSD**.
